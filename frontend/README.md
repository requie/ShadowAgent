# Frontend

This frontend will be built using React (e.g., Next.js) with a modern, accessible design inspired by our evaluation of dark-web intelligence dashboards. It will consume APIs exposed by the backend and provide dashboards, alerts, configuration interfaces, and real-time updates.

## Planned structure

- `src/` – React components and pages.
- `src/components` – reusable UI components.
- `src/pages` – page routes and API integration.
- `public/` – static assets and images.

Additional modules and styling will be added as development progresses.
